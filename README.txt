# CreateWriteReadDeleteTextFilesFolders
Console Text Editor w/ Java that lets the user create, write, read and delete textfiles as well as create and delete folders.
This program uses java.io and java.nio packages for the data streams. In a GUI application, there would be the option to live edit
the file as well but this can't be achieved through the console. However, you can add the functionallity to append text to already 
existing textfiles, or use the program as a tool to write scripts immediatelly from the console (if you run it with javac and
java). You can create and delete folders in any directory (you set the path), and create, write, read, delete textfiles in any directory (again, you set the path).
